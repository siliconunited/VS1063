# VS1063
> VS1063 is the newest IC in the VLSI Solution's MP3 slave processor family. As a first in VLSI's over a decade long history of creating innovative audio IC products, VS1063 is as much aimed at encoding as it is at decoding audio.
> The VS1063 IC can encode an unforeseen multitude of audio formats, from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis to G.711 u-law, G.711 A-law, G.722 and 16-bit PCM. The proprietary MP3 encoder and Ogg Vorbis encoder have been carefully tuned for highest possible audio fidelity for high-quality audio streaming or recording.
